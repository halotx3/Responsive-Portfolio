                Hello, I'm Chris. My interests are mainly  video games, wrestling, anime, and food(can't go wrong with food am i right??).
                My current favorite game is Escape from Tarkov made by Battle State Games. My favorite match so far this year was Koto Ibushi vs. Will Ospreay for the Never OpenWeight Champion 
                <br>at Wrestle Kingdom 13.
                Attack On Titan is my current favorite anime as I love the complexity and depth it has. And of course as long as the food is good I'm cool. 
            </p>

                I currently work for GE Digital inside the Digital Operations Center, where I help in resolving issues that could affect business continuty. I've been working here since about Febuary 
                of 2017, and it really has been a great learning experience over the past 2 years, and I know that this coding bootcamp will be a great continuation.
